# Samajसेतु

The SamajSetu project aims
to bridge communication gaps between the speech and hearing-impaired community
and the public. The mobile app offers real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL)
translation using Flutter, WebRTC, and AI/ML models like YOLO and CNN for
audio-visual processing. A key feature is customizable ISL translations based on
regional variations, enabling users to communicate in their native sign languages.
Designed for online and offline use, the app's modular architecture allows integration
into sectors like education, banking, and transportation. By enhancing inclusivity and
accessibility, the project fosters meaningful interactions and has long-term potential
through NGO partnerships and CSR support.
